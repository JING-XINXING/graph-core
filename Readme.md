# Reactome Interactors


## What is the Reactome Interactors project
Reactome Interactors Project is aiming to provide information about protein interactions for Reactome data.
This project is micro-service based web-application built using following components:
<ul>
<li>Spring Boot</li>
<li>Spring Data Neo4j</li>
<li>Neo4j</li>
</ul>

#### Setup
The application will attempt to use a Neo4j standalone server running on standard port:7474.

#### Installing Neo4j
Neo4j can be installed in the command line

```
wget -O - https://debian.neo4j.org/neotechnology.gpg.key| apt-key add -
echo 'deb http://debian.neo4j.org/repo stable/' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/neo4j.list
aptitude update
aptitude install neo4j
```

Neo4j will be installed to folders
```
/etc/neo4j  (properties)
/usr/share/neo4j (library)
/var/lib/neo4j (data)
```

!!! CAUTION  !!!
http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/server-installation.html
This approach to running Neo4j as a server is deprecated. We strongly advise you to run Neo4j from a package where feasible.
You can build your own init.d script. See for instance the Linux Standard Base specification on system initialization, or one of the many samples and tutorials.
http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/LSB_3.1.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/tocsysinit.html
http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/442412-managing-linux-daemons-with-init-scripts

#### Neo4j Shell commands

Neo4j can be controlled in the command line.

```
sudo service neo4j-service start
sudo service neo4j-service stop
sudo service neo4j-service status
sudo service neo4j-service restart
sudo service neo4j-service info
```

#### Starting the application
The application can be started using:
```
spring-boot:run
```

#### Neo4j Authentication

Neo4j Server is bundled with a Web server answering only requests from the local machine. This behavior can be changed in ```/conf/neo4j-server.properties```.
Neo4j requires clients to supply authentication credentials. The authentication data is stored under ```/var/lib/neo4j/data/dbms/auth```.
Authentication can also be changed in the Neo4j-Browser with the command:
```
:server change-password
```

#### Authentication in the application

Authentication has to be provided either by setting System arguments or passing them in command line:
```
spring-boot:run "-Drun.jvmArguments=-Dusername=user -Dpassword=password
```
#### Loading the initial dataset

Currently the initial Reactome data set can be loaded using the REST-request
```
http://localhost:8080/load
```

#### API

Loading Data:

If creating a new index it is advised to delete all data from the Database:
```
http://localhost:8080/cleanDb
```
Load entire ReactomeDataSet
```
http://localhost:8080/loadAll
```
Constraints can be created using:
```
http://localhost:8080/createConstraints
```
Load a singe Instance for testing 
```
http://localhost:8080/load/stId
http://localhost:8080/load/dbId
```

Intact
```
http://localhost:8080/loadIntact
```


TODO



#### Logging
AOP is 

To see more spring behaviour (e.g. neo4jRequestHandler, connectionPooling ...) set Spring root logging level to DEBUG 
```
logging.level.=DEBUG
```

#### Project Structure
The application follows a basic spring multitier architecture:
<ul>
<li>Presentation Layer - SpringMVC</li>
<li>Service Layer - Service and Spring Transactions </li>
<li>Persistance Layer - partly provided by SpringData repositories</li>
<li>Database - Neo4j</li>
</ul>

#### SpringDataNeo4j-4 (SND4)
SDN4 (version 4.0.0) has been rewritten to support Neo4j as a standalone server.
It utilizes Cypher and HTTP to communicate with the database.

SDN4 provides among other things:
<ul>
<li>Object-Graph-Mapping of annotated POJO entities</li>
<li>Repository infrastructure. Repositories provide commonly used persistance methods and can be extended by annotated, named or derived "finder" methods</li>
</ul>

#### SDN4 Problems
Since SDN4 has been rewritten recently there are still issues that caused problems and features that are missing.

Problems occurred in this project
<ul>
<li>SDN4 is currently unable to persist rich relationships and will throw an Nullpointer exception depending on the number of relationships and saving depths. This can be avoided by reducing the saving depth. This is currently a JIRA issue in SDN4 and will be fixed with version 4.0.1</li>
<li> Undirected or Cyclist Relationships will go into an infinite loop in the objects returned. This is currently a JIRA issue in SDN4 and will be fixed with version 4.0.1</li>
<li>Collections are not supported as relationship container in POJOs. Using Collections will result in losing data! It is recommended to always use Sets.</li>
</ul>

Missing features and current "workarounds"
<ul>
<li>SDN4 approach is quite similar to e.g. hibernate. Instead of Cascading and Lazy or Eager loading it is possible to specify search or saving depth. The proble is that the CRUD methods provided by SDN4 are entirely based on the GraphId. The derived "finder" methods do not support a depth parameter. By default depth is defined as 1. This is planned to be implemented for future versions. </li>
<li>Workarounds: 
<ul>
<li>```findOne(graphId,depth)``` where the GraphId is retrieved by an additional query to neo4j with a derived finder method.</li>
<li>```Session.loadall(class, new Filter ("property","propertyValue"),depth)```
</ul>
</li>
<li>Currently SDN4 does not offer any Merge method. This is especially a hindrance since the uniqueness of an entity is ensured by the automatically created GraphId. In a project where entries are based on an external identifier(dbId) save cannot be an option. To avoid this problem the first option is to write a merge method in cypher (similar to the one shown below). The second is the use of a combination of find and save methods. With both options cascading saves (saves with depth > 0) will be a problem.</li>
</ul>

## SDN4

#### Object Graph Mapping 
When an entity is constructed from a node or relationship OGM comes into play.The framework will attempt to map fields of an object to node properties or related nodes. SDN4 supports mapping annotated and non-annotated objects models. An EntityAccessStrategy is used to control how objects are read from or written to. The strategy is using the following convention:
<ol>
<li>Annotated method (getter/setter)</li>
<li>Annotated field</li>
<li>Plain method (getter/setter)</li>
<li>Plain field</li>
</ol>

#### POJOs
Nodes (and Relationships) are modeled as simple POJOs with a few annotations; 
<ul>
<li>Nodes are declared using the ```@org.neo4j.ogm.annotation.NodeEntity``` annotation.</li>
<li>Relationships are declared using the ```@org.neo4j.ogm.annotation.RelationshipEntity``` annotation.</li>
<li>Entities must have an empty public constructor to allow spring to construct the objects</li>
<li>Fields of an entity are by default mapped to properties of the node.</li>
<li>Fields referencing another node or relationship entity are linked with relationships.</li>
<li>All parent classes will be added as labels, retrieving nodes via parent type is possible. (in a case class A extends class B extends, labels of class A will only be A and C. To workaround that problem just add @NodeEntity to all classes in hierarchy)</li>
<li>Fields can be annotated with @Property, @GraphId, @Transient or @Relationship. @Transient fields wonâ€™t be persisted to the graph database.</li>
</ul>

Example
```
@NodeEntity
public abstract class Entity {

    //id is a necessary unique identifier for Neo4j. It will be generated automatically.
    @GraphId
    private Long id;

    private Long dbId;
    private String stId;
    private String name;

    @Relationship(type = "RELATIONSHIP_TYPE", direction = Relationship.OUTGOING)
    private Set<SOME_POJO> pojos;

    public Entity(Long dbId, String stId, String name) {
        this.dbId = dbId;
        this.stId = stId;
        this.name = name;
    }

    //Getters and Setters
    ...
```

#### Neo4j Template

SDN4 offers a Neo4jTemplate as an additional way of interacting with the Neo4j graph database. Neo4jTemplate is based on the ```org.neo4j.ogm.session.Session``` object and is essentially a wrapper around Session, exposing its methods and handles transactions.

#### Neo4j Session

The Session provides methods to load, save or delete objects. 

#### Repositories

SDN4 provides a repository infrastructure. Repositories consist of interfaces declaring functionality in each repository. Repositories provide commonly used persistence methods but are extensible by annotated methods, or derived finder methods. Repositories are based on the ```org.neo4j.ogm.session.Session``` object. 

Example
```
@Repository
public interface EntityRepository extends GraphRepository<Entity> {
//    GraphRepository cannot be of Type T

    @Query("MATCH (n:LABEL)<-[r:RELATIONSHIP_TYPE]-(y) " +
           "WHERE n.property={0} AND r.property={1} " +
           "RETURN n")
    Iterable<Entity> getSomeEntities1(String param1, Integer param2);

    @Query("MATCH (n:LABEL)<-[r:RELATIONSHIP_TYPE]-(y) " +
           "WHERE n.property={param1} AND r.proerty={param2}" +
           "RETURN n")
    Iterable<Entity> getSomeEntities2(@Param("param1") String param1, @Param("param2") Integer param2);

    //Derived finder methods
    Entity findByStId(String stId);
    Entity findByDbId(Long dbId);
    ...
```

#### Service

Service layer is as a wrapper around the repositories providing logic to operate on the data sent to and from the DAO. Transaction handling can be done in this layer using @Transactional.

Example
```
@Service
public final class EntityService {

    @Autowired
    private EntityRepository entityRepository;

    public Entity findByDbId(Long dbId) {
        return entityRepository.findByDbId(dbId);
    }

    //repositories already provide basic CRUD methods that don't need to be defined in the repositories.
    public Iterable<Entity> findAll() {
        return entityRepository.findAll();
    }
    ...
```

#### Setup Configuration and Bootstrapping 

Spring boot is used to bootstrap and launch a Spring application from a Java main method. Neo4j Configuration is done by overriding Neo4jServer and SessionFactory. As Beans they are accessible to spring. Connecting to Neo4j is handled by spring

Example
```
@Import(MyConfiguration.class)
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}

@SpringBootApplication // same as @Configuration @EnableAutoConfiguration @ComponentScan
@EnableNeo4jRepositories
@EnableTransactionManagement
public class MyConfiguration extends Neo4jConfiguration {

    @Override
    @Bean
    public Neo4jServer neo4jServer() {
        System.setProperty("username", "neo4j");
        System.setProperty("password", "reactome");
        return new RemoteServer("http://localhost:7474");
    }

    @Override
    @Bean
    public SessionFactory getSessionFactory() {
        return new SessionFactory("uk.ac.ebi.reactome.domain");
    }

    @Override
    @Bean
    public Session getSession() throws Exception {
        return super.getSession();
    }

    @Override
    @Bean
    public Neo4jOperations neo4jTemplate() throws Exception {
        return new Neo4jTemplate(getSession());
    }
}
```

###### Writing

Create node with multiple labels and properties
```
CREATE (n:LABEL1:LABEL2:LABEL3{dbId:12345,stId:"R_HSA_12345"}) RETURN n
```
Merge node on dbId

```
MERGE (n:LABEL1:LABEL2:LABEL3 {dbId:12345})
ON CREATE SET n = {dbId:12345,stId:"R_HSA_12345"}
ON MATCH  SET n += {stId:"R_HSA_12345"}
RETURN n
```

Create relationship between two nodes using dbId
```
MATCH(a {dbId:12345}),(b {dbId:12346})
MERGE (a)<-[r:RELATIONSHIP_TYPE]-(b)
RETURN COUNT(r)=1")
```

Create relationship with property "cardinality" between two nodes using dbId
```
MATCH(a {dbId:{0}}),(b {dbId:{1}})
MERGE (a)<-[r:RELATIONSHIP_TYPE]-(b)
ON CREATE SET r =  {cardinality:1}
ON MATCH  SET r += {cardinality:(r.cardinality+1)}
RETURN COUNT(r)=1")
```

Delete all nodes and relationships
```
MATCH (n) OPTIONAL MATCH (n)-[r]-() DELETE n,r
```

#### Neo4j Indexing

The MATCH will use an index if possible. If there is no index, it will lookup up all nodes carrying the label and see if the property matches. Indexes are always specified for specific labels.

Creating index (only one property can be specified per index)
```
CREATE INDEX ON :LABEL(property)
```

Dropping index
```
DROP INDEX ON :LABEL(property)
```

#### Neo4j Constraints

Data integrity can be enforced using constraints. Unique constraints can be created on nodes or relationships. Existence constraints are only available in Neo4j Enterprise Edition.
It is possible to have multiple constraints per label. Adding a unique property constraint will also add an index on that property. Constraints are label specific!

Creating constraint (only one property can be be set to unique for each constraint)
```
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (n:LABEL) ASSERT n.dbId IS UNIQUE
```

Drop constraint
```
DROP CONSTRAINT ON (n:LABEL) ASSERT n.dbId IS UNIQUE
```

"spring" 
Entities handled by Spring Data Neo4j must have an empty constructor to allow the library to construct
the objects.


Annotated and non-annoted objects can be used within the same project without issue. There is an
EntityAccessStrategy used to control how objects are read from or written to. The default
implementation of this uses the following convention:
1. Annotated method (getter/setter)
2. Annotated field
3. Plain method (getter/setter)
4. Plain field

Fields that are annotated as @Transient or declared with the transient modifier are exempted
from persistence. All fields that contain primitive values are persisted directly to the graph. All fields
convertible to a String using the Spring conversion services will be stored as a string. Spring Data
Neo4j includes default type converters that deal with the following types:
â€¢ java.util.Date to a String in the ISO 8601 format: "yyyy-MM-ddâ€™Tâ€™HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX"
â€¢ java.math.BigInteger to a String property
â€¢ java.math.BigDecimal to a String property
â€¢ binary data (as byte[] or Byte[]) to base-64 String
â€¢ java.lang.Enum types using the enumâ€™s name() method and Enum.valueOf()





/**
 * how to generally manage a doubly-linked list using SDN 4, specifically for the case where the underlying graph uses a single relationship type between nodes, e.g.

 (post:Post)-[:NEXT]->(post:Post)

 What you can't do

 Due to limitations in the mapping framework, it is not possible to reliably declare the same relationship type twice in two different directions in your object model, i.e. this (currently) will not work:

 class Post {
@Relationship(type="NEXT", direction=Relationship.OUTGOING)
Post next;

@Relationship(type="NEXT", direction=Relationship.INCOMING)
Post previous;
}

 What you can do

 Instead we can combine the @Transient annotation with the use of annotated setter methods to obtain the desired result:

 class Post {
 Post next;

 @Transient Post previous;

 @Relationship(type="NEXT", direction=Relationship.OUTGOING)
 public void setNext(Post next) {
 this.next = next;
 if (next != null) {
 next.previous = this;
 }
 }
 }

 As a final point, if you then wanted to be able to navigate forwards and backwards through the entire list of Posts from any starting Post without having to continually refetch them from the database, you can set the fetch depth to -1 when you load the post, e.g:

 findOne(post.getId(), -1);

 Bear in mind that an infinite depth query will fetch every reachable object in the graph from the matched one, so use it with care!
 */




 A query such as

 MATCH (user:User {name: {username})-[rating:RATED]->(movie:Movie) RETURN u,r,m


 executed by Session.query() will continue to return a Result which contains keys for user, rating and movie but the values are now domain node and relationship entities linked by relationships returned in the query.

 This will make it much easier to deal with the results of custom queries and improve performance since your code will no longer need an additional load of the entity by ID.
